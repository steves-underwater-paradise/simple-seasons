# Simple Seasons

Minecraft mod that adds a simple season system.

## Features

- Per-block, per-biome season colors
    - Resource pack-based
    - Automatic registration of block/item colors defined in resource packs using Fabric API
    - Hot reloading (reloading season colors while in a world)
- Smooth transition between seasons
    - Seasons gradually progress into the next season
    - Season colors are updated every N seconds on all clients
- Dry and wet seasons
    - Used in savannas (dry climate; `#c:climate_dry`) and jungles (wet climate; `#c:climate_wet`) by default
    - Configurable per-biome by changing the biome tag `data/simple_seasons/tags/worldgen/biome/has_wet_and_dry_seasons.json`
- Per-world seasons
    - Any world with unfixed time will have seasons
- Ice and snow formation (during winter) and melting (during other seasons)
    - Ice won't form on oceans
    - Snow can pile up on ice (by default)
- Default built-in resource pack
    - Season colors for vanilla Minecraft blocks and items
- Config options (and a config GUI using YACL)
    - Season progress update rate
    - Season length multiplier
